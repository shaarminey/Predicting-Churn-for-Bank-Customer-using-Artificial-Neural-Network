# Introduction

In any customer-based business, retaining the customer is the most valuable asset for the organization. They emphasize the higher costs associated with attracting new customers than retaining existing customers and the fact that long-term customers tend to produce more profits. So many competitive organizations have realized that a key strategy for survival within the industry is to retain existing customers. And this leads to the importance of churn management. Customer churn (also known as customer attrition) occurs when a customer stops using a company's products or services.

Why is customer churn management essential for business?

-To identify issues with its services (for example, bad product/service quality, poor customer service, the wrong target demographic, etc.)

-To make proper strategic decisions that will lead to improved customer satisfaction and, as a result, higher customer retention.

# About the dataset
For this kernel, I chose a dataset from Bank as Banks are no exception in this churning rule. There are columns of information about the bank customers and also their status of retention in the bank.

# Objective of this project

1. To understand and predict customer churn for a bank by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
   -to identify and visualize the factors contributing to customer churn. 
   
2. To build an ANN model to predict whether a customer will churn or not. 

3. To evaluate the prediction model on how accurate is the prediction.
